# Documentation for `server/models/Content.js`

## Overview

The `Content.js` file defines the Mongoose schema and model for representing content within the
application's backend. Located in the `server/models` directory, it is a crucial part of the data
layer, responsible for structuring and interacting with content data stored in the MongoDB database.
This model is likely used to manage user-generated content or content created by the application
itself, based on user preferences or inputs.

The `Content` model defines the structure for content items, including details such as the user who
created it, title, topic, goal, platform, tone, various content options (text, hashtags, alt text,
image), privacy settings, and the model used for content generation (if applicable). It leverages
Mongoose's schema definition capabilities to enforce data integrity and provides a convenient
interface for database operations related to content.

This file is a core component of the server-side logic, interacting with the database and likely
used by other server-side modules (like controllers or route handlers) to manage content creation,
retrieval, updating, and deletion. It's expected that frontend components in the `src` directory
will interact with backend API endpoints that utilize this model to display and manipulate content.

## Schema: `ContentSchema`

The `ContentSchema` defines the structure of a content document in the MongoDB database. It uses
Mongoose's schema definition syntax to specify the fields, their data types, validation rules, and
relationships.
