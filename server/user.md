# Documentation for `server/user.js`

## Overview

The `server/user.js` file defines the API endpoints related to user authentication, profile
management, password reset, email verification, and user content management for the Turbocontent
application. It utilizes Express.js to handle routing and interacts with MongoDB models (`User.js`,
`Content.js`) for data persistence. The file also leverages middleware (`auth.js`) for
authentication and external libraries like `jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt`, `google-auth-library`,
`nodemailer`, and `crypto` for security, Google OAuth, email handling, and cryptographic operations.

This file is a crucial part of the backend server, responsible for managing user accounts and
securing access to user-specific data and functionalities within the Turbocontent application. It
handles user registration, login, profile updates, password recovery, and provides endpoints to
manage user-generated content.

**Project Structure Context:**

- Located in the `server` directory, indicating it's part of the backend server-side logic.
- Imports models from `server/models` (`User.js`, `Content.js`) to interact with the database.
- Imports middleware from `server/middleware` (`auth.js`) for authentication, ensuring secure access
  to protected routes.
- Exports `userRoutes` function, which is likely imported and used in the main server file
  (`server/index.js`) to mount these routes onto the Express application.

## Function: `userRoutes(app)`

This function sets up all the user-related API routes on the provided Express `app` instance.

**Parameters:**

- `app`: An Express.js application instance.

**Return Value:**

- None (modifies the `app` instance by adding routes).

**Usage:**
