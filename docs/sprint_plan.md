### 2. Dependencies & Risks

- **Dependencies:**
    - **Backend APIs:** User Registration, Login, and basic Admin functionalities require
      corresponding backend API endpoints to be at least minimally functional.
    - **AI Model API Access:** Access and basic integration with at least one AI model API (e.g.,
      OpenAI) is crucial for content generation.
- **Risks:**
    - **AI API Integration Complexity:** Integrating with AI APIs might be more complex than
      initially estimated, potentially delaying content generation functionality.
    - **Backend API Delays:** If backend API development lags, it will block progress on front-end
      user and admin features.
    - **Unforeseen Technical Issues:** Unexpected technical challenges may arise during refactoring
      (moving logic to `Content.jsx`) or implementation, requiring time for debugging and
      resolution.

### 3. Definition of Done (DoD) for Sprint 1

- **Functionality:**
    - Content generation logic is successfully moved to `Content.jsx`.
    - Users can register and log in to the application.
    - Basic text content generation is functional based on user input (topic, platform, tone) using
      at least one integrated AI model.
    - A real-time preview of the generated content is displayed in `Content.jsx`.
    - Loading states and progress indicators are implemented for content generation and user
      actions.
    - Basic error handling and user feedback mechanisms (e.g., toast notifications for
      errors/success) are implemented in key areas (authentication, content generation).
    - A basic UI for `Admin.jsx` is in place, allowing for rudimentary user management (listing
      users).
- **Code Quality:**
    - Code is well-commented and follows consistent coding style guidelines (Prettier).
    - Code is pushed to the main branch and builds successfully.
    - Basic unit tests are written for core functionalities where feasible (prioritize testing
      backend logic if time permits).
- **Documentation:**
    - Sprint plan and sprint review documentation are updated.
    - README.md is updated with any significant changes or progress made during the sprint.

**Sprint Goal Success Measurement:**

The sprint will be considered successful if users can register, log in, and generate basic social
media content with a real-time preview. The basic admin UI should also be functional. Achieving
these functionalities will demonstrate core viability and provide a platform for further feature
development and user feedback.
