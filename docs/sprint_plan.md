**Total Story Points: 22**

**Item Breakdown & Details:**

1.  **Implement Basic Content Generation Flow in `Content.jsx` (5 Story Points)**

    - **Description:** Develop the core logic within `Content.jsx` to capture user inputs (topic,
      goal, platform, tone) and send a request to the backend for content generation. Integrate with
      the Gemini API for text generation. Display the initial generated text output.
    - **Tasks:**
        - Create input fields in `Content.jsx` for topic, goal, platform, and tone.
        - Implement API call to backend `/api/content/generate` endpoint (to be created).
        - Backend service to call Gemini API based on inputs.
        - Receive generated text from backend and display it in `Content.jsx`.
    - **Dependencies:** Backend API endpoint `/api/content/generate` needs to be available (part of
      backend tasks). Gemini API access and basic integration.
    - **Risks:** Gemini API integration complexity, API rate limits, potential delays in backend API
      development.

2.  **Real-time Preview of Generated Content in `Content.jsx` (3 Story Points)**

    - **Description:** Implement a dynamic preview area in `Content.jsx` that updates in real-time
      as users modify input fields. Display the generated text in this preview area.
    - **Tasks:**
        - Create a preview area in `Content.jsx`.
        - Connect input fields to the preview area using React state management.
        - Ensure preview updates dynamically on input changes.
    - **Dependencies:** Basic content generation flow needs to be in place to display something in
      the preview.
    - **Risks:** Performance issues with real-time updates if not implemented efficiently. State
      management complexity in React.

3.  **Implement User Registration & Login (5 Story Points)**

    - **Description:** Develop user registration and login functionalities using `Login.jsx`,
      `SignUp.jsx`, and backend authentication (`user.js`, `auth.js`). Securely store user
      credentials (hashed passwords).
    - **Tasks:**
        - Design and implement UI for `Login.jsx` and `SignUp.jsx`.
        - Create backend API endpoints for user registration (`/api/auth/register`) and login
          (`/api/auth/login`) in `user.js`.
        - Implement password hashing and secure storage in the backend.
        - Implement JWT-based authentication using `auth.js` middleware.
        - Basic client-side and server-side validation for registration and login forms.
    - **Dependencies:** Backend server setup and database (if needed for user storage - can use
      in-memory for initial sprint if database setup is a blocker, but MongoDB preferred as per
      project structure).
    - **Risks:** Security vulnerabilities in authentication implementation, database setup delays,
      frontend-backend integration issues.

4.  **Implement "Forgot Password" & "Reset Password" Functionality (3 Story Points)**

    - **Description:** Enable users to recover their passwords using `Forgot.jsx` and `Reset.jsx`.
      Implement email-based password reset flow.
    - **Tasks:**
        - Design and implement UI for `Forgot.jsx` and `Reset.jsx`.
        - Create backend API endpoints for forgot password (`/api/auth/forgot-password`) and reset
          password (`/api/auth/reset-password`) in `user.js`.
        - Implement email sending functionality for password reset links (using a simple email
          service or mock for development).
        - Generate and validate password reset tokens.
        - Update password in the database.
    - **Dependencies:** Email sending service setup (or mock), User Registration & Login
      functionality needs to be in place.
    - **Risks:** Email service integration issues, security risks in password reset flow if not
      implemented correctly.

5.  **Add Robust Error Handling and User Feedback Mechanisms (2 Story Points)**

    - **Description:** Implement basic error handling throughout the application. Display
      user-friendly error messages for common scenarios (e.g., API errors, form validation errors).
    - **Tasks:**
        - Implement global error handling in the frontend (using error boundaries or similar).
        - Return appropriate error codes and messages from backend API endpoints.
        - Display error messages to the user using toasts or alerts.
        - Implement basic form validation error messages in the UI.
    - **Dependencies:** All other tasks, as error handling needs to be integrated across
      functionalities.
    - **Risks:** Incomplete error handling, generic error messages that are not helpful to users.

6.  **Implement Loading States and Progress Indicators (2 Story Points)**

    - **Description:** Implement visual feedback to users during API calls and content generation
      processes. Use loading spinners or progress bars to indicate that the application is working.
    - **Tasks:**
        - Implement loading spinners or progress bars for content generation API calls.
        - Implement loading indicators for user authentication API calls.
        - Ensure loading indicators are displayed during asynchronous operations.
    - **Dependencies:** Tasks involving API calls (Content Generation, User Auth).
    - **Risks:** Loading indicators not being displayed consistently, poor user experience due to
      lack of feedback.

7.  **Implement Consistent Visual Language & Theming (Chakra UI Defaults) (2 Story Points)**
    - **Description:** Apply Chakra UI default theme and components across the application to
      establish visual consistency and a basic design system.
    - **Tasks:**
        - Ensure all UI components in `Login.jsx`, `SignUp.jsx`, `Content.jsx`, `Navbar.jsx`,
          `BottomNavigationBar.jsx` are implemented using Chakra UI components.
        - Apply Chakra UI default theme across the application.
        - Basic styling adjustments for layout and spacing using Chakra UI styling props.
    - **Dependencies:** UI component development for other tasks.
    - **Risks:** Inconsistent application of Chakra UI, basic theming not being visually appealing
      enough.

**Dependencies Summary:**

- Backend API endpoints are a dependency for frontend tasks (Content Generation, User Auth).
- User Registration & Login is a dependency for "Forgot Password" & "Reset Password".
- Error Handling and Loading States are dependent on other tasks that involve API calls and user
  interactions.

**Risks Summary:**

- Gemini API integration complexity and potential limitations.
- Backend server setup and API development delays.
- Security vulnerabilities in authentication and password reset flows.
- State management complexity in React for real-time preview and UI updates.
- Database setup and integration (if needed for user storage in this sprint).

**Definition of Done for Sprint 1:**

- **Functionality:**
    - Users can successfully register and log in to the Turbocontent application.
    - Users can initiate content generation by providing topic, goal, platform, and tone.
    - The application generates initial text content suggestions using Gemini API.
    - A real-time preview displays the generated text content.
    - Users can initiate the "Forgot Password" and "Reset Password" flows.
- **User Experience:**
    - Basic error handling is implemented, and users receive feedback on actions (loading, success,
      error messages).
    - Loading indicators are displayed during content generation and authentication processes.
    - Consistent visual language is applied across key pages using Chakra UI default theme and
      components.
- **Code Quality & Deployment:**
    - All code is committed to the main branch and is reviewed.
    - The application is deployable (even if deployed to a development environment, not production).
    - Basic unit tests are in place for core functionalities (if time permits - prioritize core
      functionality first).

This Sprint Plan focuses on building the essential foundation of Turbocontent, delivering core
content generation and user authentication functionalities within a two-week sprint. This will
provide a working prototype to demonstrate the core value proposition and gather initial feedback.
