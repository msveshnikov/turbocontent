| :------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P1**   | **1. Basic Content Generation Workflow**     | Implement the core flow: Allow users to input a topic, select a goal (from a limited set like 'engagement'), choose a platform (initially focus on one, e.g., 'Twitter'), and select a tone (e.g., 'informative'). Generate basic text-based content based on these inputs. This is the heart of Turbocontent. |
| **P1**   | **2. User Login and Signup**                 | Enable user registration and login functionality. This is crucial for user management, personalization, and future features like saving content and profile management. Implement basic authentication and user data storage.                                                                                  |
| **P2**   | **3. Basic UI Framework & Navigation**       | Set up the basic UI structure using React and Chakra UI, including essential pages (Landing, Content, Login, Signup) and navigation (Navbar). Focus on creating a functional, albeit basic, user interface to interact with core features.                                                                     |
| **P2**   | **4. Platform & Tone Selection UI Elements** | Develop the UI elements (dropdowns, radio buttons, etc.) within `Content.jsx` to allow users to select their target platform and desired tone. These elements will feed into the content generation workflow.                                                                                                  |
| **P3**   | **5. Backend API Setup & Placeholder AI**    | Establish the basic backend API structure using Node.js/Express. Create an endpoint for content generation and integrate a placeholder AI service (or a simple rule-based generator) within `gemini.js`. This will allow testing the end-to-end flow, even if the AI is rudimentary initially.                 |

### 2. Explanation of Prioritization

- **P1 - High Priority (Must-Have):**

    - **Basic Content Generation Workflow:** This is the core value proposition of Turbocontent.
      Without this, the application is non-functional. It's essential to get this working, even in a
      simplified form, to validate the concept and provide a foundation for more advanced features.
    - **User Login and Signup:** Enabling user accounts is critical for building a platform that can
      offer personalized experiences and retain users. It's a fundamental building block for future
      growth and feature additions.

      the application. While aesthetics can be refined later, a basic, navigable structure is
      essential for testing and early user feedback.
    - **Platform & Tone Selection UI Elements:** These UI elements are directly tied to the core
      content generation workflow and user experience. They need to be in place to allow users to
      define their content requirements.

- **P3 - Lower Priority (Foundation for Future):**
    - **Backend API Setup & Placeholder AI:** Setting up the backend API and integrating a
      placeholder AI service provides the technical infrastructure for future AI enhancements and
      scaling. While a sophisticated AI is not required for Sprint 1, establishing the connection
      and basic flow is crucial.

**Features deliberately excluded from Sprint 1 (but important for future sprints):**

- **Real-time Preview:** While highly desirable, it adds complexity and can be deferred to a later
  sprint once the core generation logic is stable.
- **Platform-Specific Previews & Mockups:** These are valuable but not critical for initial
  functionality. Focus on generating content first.
- **Granular Customization & Refinement Tools:** These are enhancements for later sprints, aimed at
  improving content quality and user control.
