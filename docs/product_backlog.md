  within the `Content.jsx` component.
    - **[P1 - Ready for Development] Text Generation Integration (AI Models - Gemini First):**
      Connect to Gemini API (as hinted in `gemini.js`) to generate initial text variations. Focus on
      a single reliable AI model for MVP.
    - **[P1 - Ready for Development] Basic Image Suggestion Integration (Placeholder Images):**
      Implement placeholder image display in the preview. Defer API-based image search for post-MVP
      if necessary for initial launch speed. _Decision made to prioritize text generation for MVP._
    - **[P1 - Ready for Development] Platform-Specific Output Formatting (Basic):** Implement basic
      formatting adjustments for selected platforms (e.g., truncate text for Twitter limits, basic
      hashtag placement). More sophisticated formatting in later iterations.
- **[P1 - In Progress] Real-time Preview of Generated Content in `Content.jsx`:** Implement a
  dynamic, real-time preview within `Content.jsx` that updates as users adjust inputs. _Crucial for
  user feedback and perceived value._
- **[P2 - To Do] Granular Customization & Refinement Options:** Implement UI controls (sliders,
  dropdowns) for fine-tuning tone intensity and text length. _Image style and hashtag customization
  can be deferred slightly._
- **[P2 - To Do] Platform-Specific & Device Mockup Previews (Basic Mockups):** Enhance preview to
  show basic mockups of posts on different platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter - phone view only
  initially). _Detailed device mockups can be P3._

**Removed/Completed Items:**

- **[Done] move content generation to Content.jsx** - _Assuming this is conceptually done as the
  backlog items now reflect development within `Content.jsx`._

---

**Additional Notes & Comments:**

- **MVP Definition:** The updated backlog is strongly focused on defining and delivering a Minimum
  Viable Product (MVP) quickly. The MVP should have core content generation functionality, user
  authentication, and a functional UI, even if basic.
- **Iterative Approach:** Emphasize an iterative development approach. Launch the MVP, gather user
  feedback, and then prioritize features for subsequent iterations based on user needs and market
  demands.
- **Technology Choices:** Leverage the existing technology stack as much as possible to accelerate
  development. Make pragmatic choices (e.g., local storage for initial content saving, basic image
  placeholders) to simplify the MVP.
- **User Feedback is Key:** Plan to actively solicit user feedback as soon as a usable MVP is
  available to guide future development and ensure product-market fit.
- **Prioritization Rationale:** Priorities are adjusted to reflect the need for a functional MVP
  first. Features that are essential for core functionality and user experience are prioritized (P1
  & P2). Enhancements and advanced features are deferred to later iterations (P3 & P4).

This updated backlog provides a more refined and actionable plan for the next iteration of
Turbocontent development, focusing on delivering a valuable MVP and setting the stage for future
growth. Remember to continuously review and adapt this backlog as the project progresses and you
learn more.
